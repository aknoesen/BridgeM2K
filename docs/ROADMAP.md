# ROADMAP.md — master plan and live status

Single source of truth for what is built and what is next. Each CC session flips exactly
one phase's status and records details in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

Status values: `TODO` · `IN PROGRESS` · `DONE` · `BLOCKED`.

Sessions take the **first `TODO` in order** unless andre directs otherwise. Phases are
ordered so each builds on the last. Dependencies are noted explicitly.

---

## Track A — Oscilloscope (full Scopy parity, two channels)

Spec: `docs/specs/oscilloscope.md`

| Phase | Title | Depends on | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| ARCH-1 | Channel bus in App.tsx (CH1/CH2 source abstraction) | — | DONE |
| OSC-1 | Oscilloscope panel scaffold + timebase + CH1 trace | ARCH-1 | TODO |
| OSC-2 | Second channel (CH2) + per-channel vertical controls | OSC-1 | TODO |
| OSC-3 | Edge trigger engine (source/level/slope, auto/normal/single) | OSC-2 | TODO |
| OSC-4 | Holdoff + pulse/width trigger + single-shot capture (parity) | OSC-3 | TODO |
| OSC-5 | Measurements panel + cursors (Vpp, Vrms, freq, period, duty) | OSC-3 | TODO |

## Track B — Schematic editor + NGSpice WASM (the circuit loop)

Spec: `docs/specs/schematic-ngspice.md`

| Phase | Title | Depends on | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| SPICE-1 | Integrate `eecircuit-engine` behind `SpiceEngine` adapter in a Worker | — | TODO |
| SPICE-2 | Circuit graph model + netlist generator (`core/netlist.ts`) | SPICE-1 | TODO |
| SCH-1 | Browser schematic editor MVP (place/wire R,C,L,V,opamp,gnd) | — | TODO |
| SCH-2 | Bind editor → circuit graph → netlist | SCH-1, SPICE-2 | TODO |
| LOOP-1 | Close the loop: generator → circuit → Spectrum/Scope; AC Bode | SCH-2, OSC-2 | TODO |
| LOOP-2 | Live value tuning + transient/AC toggle + −3 dB cursor | LOOP-1 | TODO |
| KICAD-1 | (Stretch) KiCad netlist import | LOOP-1 | TODO |

Notes:
- **Track A and Track B can run in parallel** up to the point LOOP-1 needs both
  `OSC-2` (a second channel to show circuit output) and `SCH-2` (a netlist to simulate).
- `SPICE-1` and `SCH-1` have no dependency on each other and can be done in either order.
- ARCH-1 is small but unblocks the whole scope track; do it first.

## Recommended session sequence

A reasonable single-developer (single CC session per row) order:

1. ARCH-1 — channel bus
2. SPICE-1 — prove ngspice WASM loads and simulates (de-risks the hardest unknown early)
3. OSC-1 — scope scaffold + CH1
4. OSC-2 — CH2
5. SPICE-2 — netlist generator
6. OSC-3 — edge trigger
7. SCH-1 — schematic editor MVP
8. OSC-4 — trigger parity
9. SCH-2 — editor → netlist
10. OSC-5 — measurements/cursors
11. LOOP-1 — close the loop + Bode
12. LOOP-2 — live tuning
13. KICAD-1 — stretch

Rationale: SPICE-1 is sequenced second on purpose. It carries the most technical risk
(WASM under the GitHub Pages base path, Worker boundary). Proving it early means the
schematic and loop work later rests on a known-good foundation rather than discovering a
blocker at LOOP-1.

## Definition of "the MVP is shippable"

Two meaningful milestones to deploy:

- **Scope MVP shippable** after OSC-3 (a working triggered two-channel scope is genuinely
  useful for Lab 3, even before holdoff/pulse parity). Deploy, then continue to OSC-4/5.
- **Circuit-loop MVP shippable** after LOOP-1 (draw an RC filter, see the Bode curve in the
  Spectrum Analyzer). This is the headline pedagogical payoff described in `CLAUDE.md`.

When a milestone deploys, note the deployed commit hash in `PROGRESS.md` and revisit the
Lab 3 prelab `<!-- TWIN: -->` markers referenced in `CLAUDE.md`.

## How to update this file

When you finish a phase, change its `Status` cell to `DONE`. If you are mid-phase and have
to stop, set `IN PROGRESS` and explain state in `PROGRESS.md`. If blocked, set `BLOCKED`
and write the blocker and what would unblock it. Never silently leave a phase you worked on
as `TODO`.
